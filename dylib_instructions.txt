To create a dynamic library (.dylib on macOS) from multiple object files (.o files), you can use the g++ (or clang++) command with specific options.
The general command structure is as follows:
Code

g++ -dynamiclib -undefined suppress -flat_namespace -o output_library_name.dylib file1.o file2.o ... fileN.o

Explanation of the options:

    -dynamiclib: This option instructs the linker to create a dynamic library (shared library) instead of an executable.
    -undefined suppress: This option tells the linker to suppress warnings about undefined symbols, which can be useful when creating libraries that might have unresolved external references that will be resolved at runtime by the application linking against it.
    -flat_namespace: This option specifies that the dynamic library should use a flat namespace, meaning that all symbols in the library are available to any other library or executable that links against it.
    -o output_library_name.dylib: This specifies the name of the output dynamic library file.
    file1.o file2.o ... fileN.o: These are the individual object files that you want to include in your dynamic library. 

Example:
If you have two object files, my_module1.o and my_module2.o, and you want to create a dynamic library named libmylib.dylib, the command would be:
Code

g++ -dynamiclib -undefined suppress -flat_namespace -o libmylib.dylib my_module1.o my_module2.o
